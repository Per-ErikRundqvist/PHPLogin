# PHPLogin
This is one of my school project for creating secured login with help av database.

To run this php software, you will need to create own client server. I recommed to download XAMPP from Apache Friends to run it. Links: https://www.apachefriends.org

And then you will need to import the database file "login_database.sql". If you use XAMPP from Apache Friends, you can run phpMyAdmin to import the sql file.

In login database it already exist 3 user info. "Admin" with password "12345", "Lucas" with password "StarWars" and "Tolkien" with password "Ring". Be aware that in database it contain very different password it is because it contain hashed password to protect from datatheft.
